## My process

### Built with

- TailwindCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [tailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This was my very first project here in FEM but, some how, forgot to post my solution...

### Continued development

Every opportunity with Tailwind something new emerges... Even is small code as this one !

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - Tailwind CSS works by generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
